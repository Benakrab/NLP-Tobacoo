Food service establishment permits, statewide, (as of 12/19/00): 8,140

Based on a permeniage derived fram our current complaint investigation loa, it is
estimated that 1,221 complaint investigations were handled statewide during the
6-monih period from January 7 to July 1. 2000.

Anticipating a statewide increase of 10 TO 25% in the number of complaint
investigations during the first year after implementation, tis estimated

that the smaicing regulation will result in from 122.to 610 additios.al complaiit
investigations.

Each complaint will require approximately 3 hoursâ€™ investigation time dincluding
avel and follow-up). Travel distance will average 15 miles per investigatior .
