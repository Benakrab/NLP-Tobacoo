“Qustat the work place, bronchitic symptoms such as coughing and sputum

become significantly more frequent. Obstructive ventilation disturbances

do not increase, smokers show an overwhelnin reater frequency

of bronchitic symptoms nh those exposed to excessive dust. The ins

ie remarkable. The effect of age seems to be rather less than that of
smoking and greater than that of dust.”

treated for ulcer diseases was included as an ulcer individual.

"Ninety per cent of the 5,249 individuals participated in a
one-year follow-up examination.

"Tife-t neidence of peptic ulcers was 9.2 per cent, and one-
year incidence 1.2 per cent. :
