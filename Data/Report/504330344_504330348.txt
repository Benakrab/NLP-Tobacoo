Regional Coordination ©

A project team has reviewed NMAs in Asia and Latin America
to.identify priority countries in which new NMAs are needed
or existing .NMAs need substantial. development. Four
countries. -in. Latin America, were recommended (see 2.4.2
above); other Latin American ‘NMAs are in need of help, but
did not meet all criteria of the selection process. It is
hoped that the special assignment to four countries in
Latin America will be agreed and supported by the member
companies concerned and their affiliates.

Project members also identified significant weak areas in
Asia where INFOTAB help is needed, including Pakistan,

Bangladesh, Hong Kong and Singapore.
