Expired Coupons:
Request Division Management to send, to the ROU, all

preprinted coupons that will be expiring. Any coupon that
has expired or is to expire within three months is

considered an expired coupon.
Work with Division Management to ensure that coupons

sent to the ROU are not lost in transit.

ible, coupons should be accumulated to

a minimum of 50 pounds (total packages) and shipped via
Consolidated Freight with third party billing to RJRT. Any
small remaining shipments under 50 pounds (total weight
of all boxes) are to be shipped Airborne - Second Day with
third party billing to RJRT. Since this is very expensive,
please minimize use of this shipping method. Do not return
coupons via UPS. Please use “printed matter” as the
freight description when completing your bill of lading.
