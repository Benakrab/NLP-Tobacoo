Zero Balance of instrumentation

Possible performance checks

Possible to use one of the particle analyzers (e.g. HAM)
as a secondard reference method.

Standard gases confirmed by independent laboratory method
Calibration of pump flow rates

Site Selection

a. Office space -

ob. Public space

c. Placement of sampling device

1. Representative of space and people occupying the space

IV. Data Collection

a.

d.

Sampling duration-1 week continuous during. period space

is open to occupancy
Ambient sampling of outside air-if CO/CO2 is unusually
elevated during the sampling interval (Day one)
