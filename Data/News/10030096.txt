Experiment With Mice

A second experiment at
Roswell Park, the soclety said,
indicates that cigarette smoke
contains an element which
mulipiles the potency of a
cancer-causing chemical mole

Mice were mieccted In the

urethan, an ‘animal anesthetic

Other mice were given not
only urethan but their throats

The second group developed
many more lung cancers than
did the first group, the soclety

actual dose of urethan had

The second study, like the

society. Was undertaten by
Drs, Joseph A. Dipagio and
