Beyond the smoke

ide-saddle. That may be some-
thing of an overstatement about the
change of image taking place at the
nation's largest cigarette manufactur-
er, Philip Morris. But not by much. On
a new Internet site, the company admits
right out to “overwhelming medical and
scientific consensus that cigarette smok-
ing causes” diseases, including lung can-
cer, emphysema and heart ailments.
This is just blowing smoke, some crit-
ies oe pares Lawyer Matthew Myers,
speakdi ag for the Campaign for Tobacco-
Free Kids, points out that i Philip Morris
hasn't stated its agreement with this
medical-scientific consensus, but has
simply admitted it exists. Still, it's a
drastic turnabout when a cigarette pro-
ducer of Philip Morris’ stature agrees
to almost inhale its chief opponents’
views and states that smolang “is addic-
tive as that term is most commonly
used today.”

A self-serving campaign? There's no
doubt about that. Indeed, The New York
Times reports, Philip Morris has
embarked on a $100 million corporate
image campaign. Coupled with that i is

ut by sharing moe information with
consumers about t1e risks of smoking,
at least those on wi ich doctors and sci-
entists agree, the company makes it
harder for future sn okers to claim igno-
rance about the dar gers of puffing away.

While fully unde rstandabie from a
business viewpoint this change in direc-
tion surely opens smoke-peddiers to
stricter regulation. Those who make
