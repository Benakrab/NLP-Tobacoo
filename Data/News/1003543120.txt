Of Family | Farm

pee Tobacco may be providing a “last strong
“""v" hold for the traditional “family farm” in the
United States—an institution which THE
MESSENGER hopes ‘will never disappear. ~
*. Stephen E. Wrather, director of the tobac-_
co division of the U.S. Department of Agri-
‘> eulture’s marketing service, made the point
~ the other day that while other types. of farms —
‘are disappearing at a rapid rate, uprooting
. “families they once supported, tobacco farms:
“Rave actually increased in number. This may
oe surprise some, but here are the figures:

“8 Nearly 9,000, 000 farms have disap-
oa - peared since 1919, about 45 per cent of
‘. the total. In 1919 there were 6,500, 000
US. farms. Last year there were only
3,800, 000. none ,
“4. Tobacco farms meanwhile have reg:
< "istered a gain of 21,000 in number since

- 1919—from 496, 000 that year to Slt

@ 000 now.
TO “The decline in: “farms, Director ‘Wrather
- . pointed out in his piece in TOBACCO NEWS,
’ has been steady except for a slight upturn
- from 1928 to 1935, when the depression
~- brought about a return to the land. After
that the downturn began at a heavier pace

.,. than ever as farmers moved to cities for

"-.<: jobs in business and industry. .
_ Nearly all types of farms have been af-

-" fected. Here are a few examples of the de- |
. clines among farms. for the major cash crops,

Le from 1919 to 1959:

Corn. farms dropped in number from
4,900,000 to 1,900,000. - .
Wheat farms declined from 2,200,-

000 to 931,000.
Cotton farms are down from 1,900,-

000 to 499,540.
'. Sugar beet farms dropped from. 47,-
0006 to 23,700.
. Among the major cash crops, only
soybean and. tobacco farms have shown

  
   
    

 

an increase.

@ We are glad the USDA man mentioned
soybeans, which have come to be.a most im-

portant crop in our own county and ‘section.

The rise in soybean farms came with dis-
covery of new product uses for the beans, —

such as soybean. oils for food: products and

: Paints. We have never been able to find out |

os -" wpon a time that bugles, even, are made of

, ae for possible new. uses.

he accented the tobacco angle rather than ~
the soybean angle. Mr. Wrather allowed that
‘the movement away from the farm to the |
‘city results largely from changes in farm —
technology and “better employment oppor-

 

.. and flock into the Big Town for job oppor-

980 to 1958, as has been reported many:
“times. since, and commonly it is said that

‘’. mechanization, better seed and fertilizer and
~ “the drop in manpower needed in farming.

; “dustry has required more manpower in years

body, the role of the modern miracle machine

“ does most of the work. With tobacco, the
_ leaves must be picked by hand. at just the

. ‘soybeans, and such a development would cer-
tainly be.no miracle in these days when good
“old soft coal can be turned into a vast var-

“tunities in business and industry,” though it
“should be said that manv who quit the farm

: In terms of people who man the farms,
* there was a drop: of 4,000.000 or so from.

‘improved methods have all contributed to -
On the other hand, rapidly-expanding in-

gone by, yet in this area, too, we find changes.
Mechanization has advanced rapidly in most
lines, automation has replaced men with ma-

will grow larger and larger as the years go
by.
In the farming process, Director Wrather
‘points out, tobacco remains a hand-tailored
-operation, compared with other major cash
crops. It requires more man-hours of per-
‘sonal attention than any other, and in har- ~

corn, soybeans and such. where machinery

checked a half-dozen times or more to make
sure the leaves are ripe.

Still, while: personal attention is still the
byword for the tobacco farmer, improved
methods and equipment have enabled him to
get bigger crop yields and a higher cash re-
turn per acre.

The TOBACCO NEWS piece pointed out
that the number of farm families who depend
‘on tobacco. runs a. good deal higher than the
actual number of. tobacco farms, since medi-
um-size and larger acreage allotments con-
tribute !o the support of two, three or more
tenant families. All in all, the piece asserts,
the historical: place of tobacco in American
agriculture is. expected to remain stable,
which is a hope which a lot of Hopkins coun-
tians will share, for tobacco is still an im-
portant crop in our farm economy:
