. Now, ith the election results providing
5 added tinpetus, ATLA 's hoping to reach
ov t¢ Republicans by depicting the civil
justice system as a kellowed conservative
institution, The ercup has even hired 8 Re-
peulicen campdign ecnsulting fim, the
Goodman Group of Lutherville, Md., to
produce a nine-minute video lo help get tis
message across.
In tke video, to be distributed nation-
ally by ATLA‘s state counterparts and
shown ta lecal civle and community
groups, trial lawyers make 2 case that they
are proud defenders of individual rights,
with a stirring backelrop of soaring eagles,
early morning farm work and sweeping
pancremas of Mount Rushmore.
Pubiie relations aside, longtime mem-
hers say ATLA 's making an even more
. findamental change in the way it
operates. White it used to rely sclely on
quiet, infiuential lobbying—backed by lav-
ish politlcal-campaign donations — ATLA
ow wants to redouble efforts througa its

deterring innovation,

Through heavily financed Icboying,
ATLA has successfully fonded off federal-
reform efiorls fr more than & decade,
though by smaller margins each time, Last
tmonfa’s Republican landslide, carrying
wil it the mandate for “common-sense
egal reform." however, has adced ur

(auizge. The group 1s determnined to more
aggressively advocate ils mission as @
defencer of the public interest,

“pm sure no one will ever give Up
talking to congressmen er legislators, and
nobedy should,” says ATLA member Leon

ing n more {gsuc-oriented and public:

 

from ils independent state counterparts,
For years, they have reached out to other
interest groups, notably environmentalists
and consumer groups, and successfully
promoted themselves as advocates for the
weak and powertess, That ground work
paid off in Arizona and Michigan this
year, Where legal-reform batlot inlitatives
were overwhelmingly defeated In the face
of huge Republican victories in congres-
stonal and gubernatorial races. In ball
cases, trial lawyers were heavily outspent
tn the campaign by the insurance industry
bat wen with suppert from Mothers
st Drank Driving and the American
‘lation of Relired Persons.

ATLA, on the other hand, has until
recently chosen to lobby discreetly behind
closed doors. Its former directar of public
E R er, & former chief coun-
sel of the House Jud.ciary Committee, was
vlewed as sect by some
ATLA member

Their strategy was to make friends

and get favors In retumn for
than fighting issues on the
merits ina pubite wi ays Pam GUbert,
lepistlative director at Pulte Citizen, the
consumer advocacy and loobying group in
Washinglon, "Thelr strategy was {hat
by supporting something publicly, you can
make someone angry.”

The clearest indication tht these days
were numbered came fast April, whea Mr,
Parker retired and was succeeded by [or-
mer Consumers Union lobbyist Linda Lin-
sen. “The change to Linda Lipsen makes &
big difference,” says Ms. Gilbert, "She
comes from the public-interest community,
and understands how to Tight a battle In a
public way,”

Not thet ATLA wit be giving up Its
seals in Washington's back rooms, The
trigl lawyers’ polltical-action committee
doled out $1.6 million in. campaign contri:
butions in the last election, spending
$262,350 on Democrals and $6,800 on Re-
publicans. “T don’t sce any change In
terms of our continued Invalvement in the
financial aspect of supporting poiltical
candidates," says Victor Pavalon, 2 Chi-
cago triat lawyer and presi¢ent’ of the
ATLA political-action committee. “Hope-
fully it will increase,”*

ATLA hopes to draw support in Cen-
gress from Republican members who are
uncomfortable with federal mandates and
prefer to leave legal reform to the states.
‘And some of ATLA'S retooled message
may well resonate with some Republi-
cans.

“True Republican values have always
been, as Isee it, the protection of (he right
of the individual," says ATLA president
Larry §. Stewart, a plaintiffs jawyer in
Miami, “That’s exactly what the civil
Justice system, is afl about.”
