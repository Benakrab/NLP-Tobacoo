Mr, Kloepfer
Proven a cause of lung cancer
“heart disease or other dread
illnesses.

“We don't claim the product
eis above suspicion,” said Wil-
liam Kioepter Jr., the tobacea
gcoup’s senior vice president,
‘who by the way disposed of
five or six filter-tip-mentholat-
eds during the one-hour pres-
entation at: the’ Press Club.
“The cigaret isn’t exoner-

ated, but it is still oa trial.”
‘THE INSTITUTES position,
emphatically put by statisti
{ clam Marvin Kastenbaum, is
s that a statistical correlation
(img cancer, for example,
bemg more prevalent among
smokers than non-smokers) is

ot proof of cause and effect.

Employing two-tcreen visual
aids, Kloepfer lambasted a
plece of research highly pubti-
clzed by the American Cancer
Society early last year. That
ploject reported ung cancers
had been generated in 12 out of
85 beagle dogs subjected in a
laboratory to cigaret smoke
inhalation for more than two
J years. we

Kloepfer said the Tobacco
- Institute has been refused ac-
cess to the basic data behind
the cancer society’s report.

 

ithe Journal of the American
Medical Assn., and when it
final'y appeared in another
scientific journal, its findings
were watered down. The print-
[ed version declared only two
dogs to have cancer signs and
these, “microscopic.”
| According to Kloepfer, this
experiment cost government
and private sources $750,000.
; ‘The leading source of funds for
lresearch on smoking and
health, he said, is the tobacco
industry itself, to the tune of
about $4% million this year,

has pre-judged cigaret smok-
ing as a lung cancer cause and
federal regulatory agencies
have “made the science fit the
pre-determined policies.”

Since smoking-causes-can-
cer'is taken as revealed truth,
negative evidence tends to be
disregarded, the tobacco itr
dustry says. Peaple who de-
fend cigarets as “not yet prov-
en guilty” begia to feel like
lonely members of a “Bat
earth society.”

But statistician. Kavtenbaum.
claimed some figures cast
doubt on a direct smoking-can-
cer link.

Women have been smoking
for many years now, he said,
but fall victim to lung cancer
Jess than men in @ “6 to 1
ratio,”

‘The British stoke ag much
‘ad Americans but have twice
the ung cancer rate. One
study found a correlation be
tween smoking and bladder
cancer; but a follow-up. also
found certain coincidence of
bladder cancer with coffee-
drinking. .

“There also may be & signif.
icant over-diagnosia of lung
cance?,” said Kastenbaum,
citing a study of autopsies that
showed 59 per cent error in
lung cancer diagnosis.

ACCORDING TO Kasten
‘baum, smoking has been iden-
tified statistically with 22 caus
es of death “including acci-
dents and suicide.”

This may only be a clue, he
said, that people who smoke
also foliow a manner of life
which subjects them to various
causes of death
The fact that some persons

added that government has a

“What are you worried
about, then?” asked a news-
man with yellow ataing on bis

KLOEPFER indicated any:
further government restric-
tions (the surgeon general
would like to ban all smacking
in public) could affect the
ivelihood of 650,000 “farm
