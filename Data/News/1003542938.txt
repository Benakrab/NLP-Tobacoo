Allen said that ‘by sheer repeti-
tion,” critics. of smoking ‘are. now
seeking to give ihe impression of
‘mounting evidence’ that smoking
is responsible for various health
problems, even though the causes
of these problems. remain in. dis-
pute among scientists. :
. “Actually, while there have been
many resolutions and repeated
stories and articles about smoking

and health in the recent past; the —

scientific situation remains large-
ly as it. was.”

Allen saia that “the litera.ure
on tobacco and health contains.
such a wide variety of fiction and!
non-fiction, fact and opinion, that

it is difficult, at best, to determine -

what the facts really are...
“However,, when one considers’
all of the available research, one
finds that much of it does not fit,
the theory as presented by those
who regard smoking as.a seriou
health hazard. :
“It is natural that the headlines
usually go to those who suggest a
possible answer to health prob-
lems, or who present a new theory
or who make a charge.
“However, ‘a chorus of loud
voices saying that tobacco is
‘guilty’ is no substitute for re-

-- Search.

“The position of the tobacco in-
dustry, on the other hand, does
not generally make much. news,”
he said, because ‘‘we do noti pre
sume to know the answers.....

Certain Things

“There are certain things we
do know,”’ Allen said: .

“We do know that the theories
regarding possible causes of lung
cancer and hearti disease are in
dispute. among scientists.

“We do know thati the original:
theory about smoking and Jung
cancer — the theory: that. smoke
was a direct, contact carcinogen--
has virtually been. abandoned,

“We do know. that in labora-

tories around’ the. world scientists .
are investigating many possible

factors in lung cancer and heart
disease, in addition to smoking.”

Allen noted that the ‘case
against smoking still rests largely
on statistical studies, whose mean-
ings are questicned by many Jead-
ing medical statisticians.”

He also said that “intensive
clinical and laboratory. research
has failed: to provide the verifica-
tion necessary to show: a cause
and effect role for smoking."

U.S. Information Agency, and a
career ambassador in the Foreign
Service.

posed of major U.. S. manufac-
turers of cigarettes, smoking to

Its principal purposes are to pro-
mote a better understanding of

seminate information relating ts
