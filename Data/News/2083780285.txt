Unser spoils Mansell’s fun

. PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — It.
' was almost a superhuman effort
for Nigel Mansell, and it still
wasn’t enough Saturday as Al
Unser Jr., the point man on the
dominating Marlboro Team
Penske, snatctied the pole for to-

i a s oe Nee evoe’s 200
at Portland International Speed-

' Way.

Mansell showed up at the

post-qualifying interview with
his driving suit soaked by perspi-

ration and his energy spent after
doing every-
thing in his

 

power to win AUTO

Jand pole,

The defending PPG Cup
ca ion did break the track
record with a lap of
tte. 651 mph, but Unser's rast
lap of 116.861, coming in the fi-
nal 60 seconds of the 30-minute
session, gave him his second
pole of the season and fifth of his
career.

“T wrung it’s neck out there,”
Mansell said of his Ford Cos-
worth-powered Lola. “I proba-
bly had one of the few cars air-
borne through half the chicane.
It was the best we could do and
I’m just ‘glad we were able to

push him as well as we did.

“But, give the Penske team
it’s due, that was a brilliant lap.”

Mansell has yet to win his first
race this season while watching
the Penske trio of Unser, former
track record-holder Emerson Fit-
tipaldi and Paul Tracy win five

of six, including the last five in a
row,

 

A Nigel Mansell pulls a mask
over his head as he prepares
for qualifications for today's
Budweiser-G.!. Joe’s 200 Indy-
car race. Mansell broke the

track record and had the pole

position until Al Unser, Jr.
snatched it away in the final
minute of Saturday’s qualifying.

Now the Englishman finds
himself surrounded by Marlboro
red and white, with Unser along-
side on the front row and Fitti-
paldi and Tracy right behind in
the second row for the start of
today’s 102-lap, 189.9-mile event
on the 1,.95-mile, nine-turn road
course.

Fittipaldi, whose record was
115.730, also broke the mark
with a 116.101, followed by Tra-
cy’s 115.685.

Rookie Jacques Villeneuve
was fifth at 115.604, followed by
Jimmy Vasser (115. 370), Robby
Gordon and Mauricio Gugi
(both 114.849) and Michael An-

dretti, a three-time Portland win-
ner and winner of the season-
opener in Australia (114.700).

Unser, who won from the pole
last month in the Indianapolis
500, said of Saturday’s perfor.
mance: “A lot of it had to do
with cloud cover that came over
near the end. The sun was beat-
ing down halfway through (the
session) and 1 was working on
the balance of the car, trying to
get it right.

“And we were also keeping an
eye on Nigel because he can
throw down a fast one at any
time.”

The pole was worth one more
point to Unser, who now leads
Fittipaldi 83-70 in the driver
standings. Andretti is third at 59,
followed by Gordon (52),
Mansell (46), and Tracy, coming
off a win at Detroit, and Vasser
(both 36).

Now Mansell, who'says he
still believes he is in the points
race with 10 events remaining,

must find a way to beat the three —-

Ilmor-powered Penskes.

“Perhaps I ought to paint my
car red and white for the race be-
cause I know with these three

Penskes around me, it’s going to
be difficult to win,” Mansell said
with a weak grin.

“But I give my boys credit,”’
he added. “Up-until one minute
to go, we thought we might have
gotten the pole. In the race, the
Penskes will be hard to beat, but
you just have to go out there and
do your best and hope for the
best.”
