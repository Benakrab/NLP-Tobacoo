New York, June 6—(UP)—
Timothy B. Hartnett, chairman
of the Tobacco Industry Research
Comittee, today urged smokers
mot to be “misled by sweeping
generalities” in a doctors’ report
on the relationship between

smoking and lung cancer. 4

Hartnett, Whose organization
is conducting its own survey into
lung cancer, charged that the re-
port releared today in Atlantic
City “ignores important enviror-
mental, georraphical, occupation-
al, physical and emotional factors
Cfiecting disease and longevity.”

they are dealing with only 168
proven primary lung cancer case
among 285 reported cases, 01
8.105 deaths which occurred in a
32-month period‘among 187,000
men who were 50 to 70 years old

Hartnett also charged that

Horn contained hias “so

vhe questions were leading, Hart
nett sald, and use of the term
‘heavy smoking” suggested excess
which “doctors generally oppose
eosin any human ectivity.”
Laboratory rescareh during the
past year has falled to, provide
any proof that smoking causes
lung cancer, Hartnett sald.
