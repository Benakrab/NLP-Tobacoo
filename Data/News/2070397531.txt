THE ARGUS
5 4-23-9b
RAMENTO — Assemblyman’ John’ Burton
California could collect more than $1 billion
OF its budget by filing suit against the tobacco in-
‘dustry to recoup public funds spent treating smoking-
preiated ilnesses.
== The San Francisco Democrat has been pushing a
Frésolution to that effect, but with little success. First,
the Republican-controlled Assembly shunted his mea-
sur ‘Off to the Rules Committee. And Monday, Repub-
icans on the Rules Committee killed it.
-Burton said he didn’t know why Republicans —
Olt eof whom are pushing measures to ease smoking
strictions — ‘would dislike his measure, which calls
it Aftoitiey General Dan Lungren to sue all tobacco
roripaniés for the cost of treating Medi-Cal patients
or nesses caused by smoking.

ath

the state budget,” he said. “Tes not a stupid, off-the--
wall idea.”

At least five states have already filed such lawsuits,
and several more are expected to do so shortly. The
Liggett Group, the smallest of the top five cigarette
makers, stunned the industry last month when it said

“jt would settle claims filed by Florida, Massachusetts,’

Mississippi, Louisiana and West Virginia. *

Despite the potential gain to the state, Assembly
Republicans felt that the decision on whether to sué
was best left to the attorney general, said Wendy.
Weber, a spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Curt
Pringle, R-Garden Grove.

Lungren spokesman Steve Telliano said the at-
torney general hadn't decided whether or not to file a
lawsuit, and hadn’t taken a position on Burton’s pro-
posal. “We're monitoring what's being filed in the
suits in other states,’ he said. :
