"An “earemarked tax” on tabacco products ta be imposed:
Suggestion of Legislators and scholars

A lot of legislatora and scholars suggested yesterday to impose an “ear-marked tax” on tobaceo
products so az to curb its consumption, and, in addition, its income could also be fully utilized for
preventing smoking hazard, promoting smoking rehabilitation education activities.

According to Article 64 of National Health Insurance Law, Legislators suggested to impose an
“ear-marked tax” for tobacco products as gocial health insurance surcharge.

According to Public Health Institute Professor Yang Min-chin, smoking related diseases occasioned
some 4 billion NTS medical expenses annually; its indirect cost could amount to as high as 46 billion
NTS every year. Therefore, it would be fair for smokers paying higher price to share this social
cost.

Professor Hu The-wei of US Berkeley Health Economics Research Institute analyzed that most
advanced countries often imposed very high cigarette tax ranging fram 60% to 80%, Tatwan’s 47%

tte tax was comparatively lower, and as « reauylt, Taiwan's everage Cigarette price was much
lower than world average at US$1.3 per pack.

The DOH deemed the suggestion of imposing “oar-matked tax” being nice, however, smokers’
Teaction would have to be taken into consideration. With little price increase on cigarette pack, the
move would be acceptable more easily by amokers.

vILelLePooz

However, part of smokers reckoned that SHPL already strictly limited their right of smoking,
imposing an “ear-marked tax” would be to cast additional stone on a person already in great
difficulry. Smokers proclaimed that their rights end interests should also be respected. Some
smokers agreed on “earemarked tax” Proposal but deemed the income should be utilized for
developing smoking rehabilitation measures, pharmaceutical products that smokers could benefit
from. (Excerpts arrenged by TIROG)
