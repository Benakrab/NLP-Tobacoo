SUBJECT: MAVERICK SPECIALS — PROGRESS REPORT.

 
 

EFFECTIVENESS OF: Pre—Sell — Harley Transition BookleCoupon — Maverick/Harley BIGIF:_

{Report on May 27 only}
PRE-SELL: Sales force encountered little if any difficulty selling Maverick to retail and wholesale accounts.
Coverage during preseil period was diminished due to affixing booklets, assembling B1G1F’s and leveling

 

inventories,

HARLEY TRANSITION BOOKLET/COUPON: Retailers report receiving many tri—fold $.50 coupons.

Booklet size was too large for King Size Box packings and covers tear tape, resulting in difficulty in opening
pack. Booklets design did a great job conveying transition message.

MAVERICK/HARLEY B1iG1F: Excellent in selling retail inventories while giving the consumer a first hand

chance to try and compare Maverick to Harley. In most cases, deals sold through at accelerated rates.
