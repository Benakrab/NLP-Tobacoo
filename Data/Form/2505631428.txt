Project Name: | Indirect Materials — direct contact hoses

 

      

Determine whether a hazard exists to the smoker from potential exposure to
chemicals potentially extracted from direct-contact hoses used to move materials in
the production facilities.

Project Leader:
Tactics and Milestones: Target Date:

Review of historical records and literature to determine if chemicals are potentially 10/30/00-12/30/00
extracted in to the material transported during use of hoses. ;

} }
Determife what factors may contribute to a materials ability to extract chémicals 11/30/00- 1/30/01
from the hoses

Objective:

 
   
 

Determine appropriate testing protocol for hoses being considered for use in facilities 1/30/01-3/30/01

Document findings and make recommendations for currently used hoses and hoses to | 6/30/01
be reviewed for use.

Implement recommendations (if appropriate)
