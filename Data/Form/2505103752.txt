Re: Requested Technical Documentation of Phytee miniCON-535 Controller Board

Dear Clint:

Please find attached the requested technical documentation of the Phytec microcontroller board used
in the INBIFO trigger setup. The compiled data sheets are part of the hardware manual. Please give
me a call, if you need the complete manual and J will sent you a copy via courier. However, my
understanding was that a comparable hardware being available at your lab will work as well.

Kind regards,
