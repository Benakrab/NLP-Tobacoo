Oear Gerry,

I've checked the posters from the last SOT meeting and listed the attributions below. Could you please
double chack to make sure they're ok

. fim curious about the ‘Philip Maris U.S.A.’ one used for posters
with Erlangen-alt the others say ‘Philip Morris intermational’. Also, do we want the word ‘sponsored! of
‘supported’? Or maybe something differant altogether?
