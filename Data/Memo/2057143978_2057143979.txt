The points agreed on are as follows:

1. Make RL-59 at the Hopewell Processing Company before the

Thanksgiving Holidays. The time required for this run
should be at least one day. Two to three days may be
required to identify any processing problems. Material

generated during the last run is to be consumer tested
in HTI and RPS.

Virginia Slims, and Parliament are to be tested
