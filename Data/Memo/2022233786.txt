Expanded Tobacco Monthly Summary - December, 1970:

Routine determinations continue on impregnated and

expanded NH3/CO2 treated tobacco. A second TC detector
and power supply has been received. to help decrease the
turn-around time on samples.

This new unit. has been temporarily modified for
determinations of Hz in the expansion tower effiluent gases.
The limit of detection for Hz in the gas is about 20: ppm.

Preliminary results. on computer output for the COÂ»,
analyses indicate a significant time saving and increased

accuracy.
