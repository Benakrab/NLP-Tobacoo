Plans and Objectives for 1983 (Charge Number 1101),

: The objectives of Entomological Research are: |.

oy

To maintain an awareness sof new processes and ‘eechnology
in relation to their eet on beetle control...

¢

The subob jectives which \ we plan to use to ‘accomplish objective A A;

. “are as follows:

y,

1. ey Determine cigarette beetle growth’ : and development pe eth

“on grades of burley, bright, oriental, ES, ET, DIET, RL, BL, and RCB tobaccos.

Criteria used to evaluate growth and development will be generation time,
larval weight, percentage of adult emergence, fertility, and fecundity of --°.
adults. This data will enable us to respond to requests regarding potential

‘for beetle infestation in these tobaccos, .. New blend concepts (short /medium

term) and new tobacco processing technology. *

hy,

2. SY nvaluutet the effect of mold on growth and development... This

“would be a basic study of the biology of the cigarette beetle. Recent reports
_in the literature indicate mold may have a positive effect on stored-product

insect growth and development. Molds occurring on tobacco will be identified,

cultured, and infoculations of tobacco cultures will be initiated. The same .
criteria as those described in No. tL shall be used. Natural tobacco flavors.
