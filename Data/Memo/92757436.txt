MEMORANDUM , March 24, 1992
‘,
To: The Members of the Executive Committee

From: Samuel D. Chilcote, Jr. i.

Today, by a vote of 8-7, the Los Angeles city Council rejected a
smoking ban in restaurants in favor of a more reasonable smoking
restriction measure. The phased-in ordinance proposal would
require 60 percent of restaurant seating space be set aside for
nonsmokers for two years. Then, the nonsmoker seating would be
increased to 70 percent. Signs stating, "smoking is permitted in
this establishment" must be posted on restaurant exteriors.

 

This measure now goes to the City Attorney for redrafting. The
new draft will be returned to the City Council for a final vote,
probably within the next 60 days. The mayor must then sign the

measure into law. We have no indication that he will not sign
this ordinance.

While we are not yet completely out of the woods in L.A., I Know
you join me in congratulating everyone who has been involved in
this effort. As you know, we have pulled out all the stops to
prevent a ban. I am very pleased by the outstanding teamwork
that has taken place. The effort to date has been extensive,
complex and complete. That complete industry effort will
continue in the same vein throughout the process.
