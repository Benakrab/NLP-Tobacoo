Dimensions of Signs for the Six Oil Retailers

For Your Information
The attached sheet summarizes the types of signs and their outer dimensions. This is meant
to be a guide for you, recognizing that I will be receiving actual size samples for each
account later this week. I will in turn forward them to Roy.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or concerns.
