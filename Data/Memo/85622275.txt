Mr. K.v.R. Dey, Jr. Arthur J. Stevens, Esquire,

Ernest Pepples, Esquire . Mr. Charles A. Tucker

FROM: John D. ke1iy WK

For your information the attached memorandum from Minneapolis
City Attorney examines the constitutional arguments made by
our attorneys in opposition to an amendment expanding the
Minneapolis sampling ordinance. Unfortunately city attorneys
in other cities have taken a different view. Happily the city

attorney's mémorandum has caused Alderman Dziedzic to withdraw
his amendment.
