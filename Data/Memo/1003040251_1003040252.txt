Philip Morris Incorporated is a strong advocate of public
° debate. It is through such discussion and analysis of the
issues that our citizens are able to reach their own personal
decisions. When, however, a federal government department
takes it upon itself to prohibit the making of that free choice,

x

we have moved out of the realm of public discussion and into
that of coercion.
This is where Mr. Califano, in his misguided zealousness,
has taken us. Rather than devoting his time and money to in-
- creased tobacco and health research, he has chosen to expend
them on a public relations campaign aimed at making smokers
appear as second class citizens whose rights are not worth
protecting. Such demagoguery serves only to cloud the issue,
_and is of no value in finding answers to public questions.
In the last twenty years Philip Morris, along with
other members of the tobacco industry, has provided more than
$70 million for independent research on smoking and health
questions. In many of these years this commitment has exceeded
that of any government department, andi has been substantially

more than the research expenditure reported by all the voluntary

health associations combined. 4003040251
