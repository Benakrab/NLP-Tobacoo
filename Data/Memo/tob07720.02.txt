RE: Sphakera Bureau Procedures

 

It is important that the Consortium speakers bureau be well
managed and focused from the start. Al and Brenda strongly
recommended that we draft procedures and Phyllis and I concur.
To that end, Wwe have attached proposed procedures.

We do not plan to discuss them at Tuesday's meeting but would

like to shar2 this draft with Al and Brenda fairly soon
thereafter.

We also need to discuss the project with F-H to ensure
coordination with Jolly Ann's tours.
