Subject: Tar/Nicotine Interaction

Using the formula derived by John Tindall, (memo attached),

April 4,

1990

one can

calculate the theoretical nicotine delivery knowing only the filler nicotine

and tar delivery of a cigarette.

ities g

Listed below are the theoretical nicotine deliveries for the third

Tar/Nicotine Interaction Study prototypes.

N = 0.0335 x T x (F + 0.19)
where N = nicotine delivery (mg)

T = tar delivery (mg)

F = filler nicotine (%)
