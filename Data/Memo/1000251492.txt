MEMORANDUM
aie TO: General Counsel

FROM: Frank Dryden

 

At Mr. Kornegay's direction I am enclosing recent correspondence
from The Children's Orthopedic Hospital and Medical Center and
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Control which is
self-explanatory. Representatives from the Bureau have advised
that it is their understanding the -inquiry was predicated on
information that children may pick up and swallow cigarettes

or cigarette butts.

We are sure the Hospital will appreciate any information on
the subject which may be available.
