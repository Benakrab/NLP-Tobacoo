“+ On December 17, 1976, ‘the following people
from New York will visit the Research Center to
discuss 5 mg products:

   

“Bob Fitzmaurice m Dick Gumz a
Bill Engelbrecht “+> Skip Long me
“AL Bissmeyer (perhaps). “

I would appreciate your leading these
discussions. They are particularly interested in
5 mg Parliament and a 5 mg free-standing brand. Please
have minutes of the discussion prepared for distribution
to Mr. W. McDowell and Mr. F. Resnik.

It might be a good time to expose these
marketing types to the high-speed photographs of smoke
issuing from various filters, particularly Parliament.

a If you have any questions, please let me
. Know. wo
