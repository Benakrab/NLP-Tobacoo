-Parliament History

Pursuant to our conversation, you will find attached several pages of a
report issued by the Research Center concerned with major changes in the

Parliament brand since the early 1960's. Please check this information
and Tet me know if there are errors or deficiencies,

As ve noted in our conversation, interest is centered on changes which
would be obvious to a consumer; for examole, recess vS. no recess, changes

in tipping length or filter construction, Single vs. dual filters and
length of filters,

Most important would be to suoply information prior to 1961 which,I trust,
will be in the Manufacturing Department's files.

Finally, a reminder that I have a deadline

of December 13 to have the infor-
mation in my hands. 7.
