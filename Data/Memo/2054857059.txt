¢ RECORDS RETENTION SCHEDULE REVISION

Enclosed is the revised Records Retention Schedule for the O4MFPU90 —
Park 500 Power House & Environmental Engineering department. The schedule
has been reviewed and approved by the Records Management Department and
Legal Counsel. This Records Retention Schedule supersedes and invalidates
any prior dated Records Retention Schedule, and all prior dated Records
Retention Schedules should be immediately destroyed.

If I may be of further assistance, please let me know.
