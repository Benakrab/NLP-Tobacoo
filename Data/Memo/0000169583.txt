“FROM  .§.F. Moss _ _ DATE August. 3, 1983 : :
“SUBJECT ._VISIT TO FT, LEONARD WOOD FOR VICEROY PRICE TEST ~ ,

PURPOSE OF VISIT

Ft. Leonard Wood is a late addition to the VICEROY military price
test, with VPR offerings beginning July 18. Previously, Ft. Knox

refused to expand the style offerings with a $1.50 VPR, so Leonard
Wood is being used as a replacement. a

 

While it was intended that a $1.50 VPR be used at this commissary, ©
ne a $1.00 off coupon has been offered in conjunction with the VPR.
- In order to monitor sales activities at the commissary and to ©

assess the appropriateness of continuing the test, Ft. Leonard

Wood was visited on Friday, July 29. The following observations

were made while visiting the Ft. Leonard Wood Commissary.

 

OBSERVATIONS

l. Sales - Approximately five cases of VKSF, two cases of ae
VSL and one case of VRL 100's were sold on July 29 (a pay
day). This was accomplished with a 6-carton maximum per

person. Prior to the test, average VICEROY volume was 90
cartons per week, all of it in VKSF. The sales volume on

this Friday represented a_26-fold increase over average
re-promotion volume. Sales would have been Substantially
higher had not the SUPPLY of RICH LIGHTS 100's been depleted

. by noon. _

VICEROY was the largest sellin brand at the commissary on
July 29, selling more cartons than Marlboro or generics.

Generic sales volume averaged 5-6 cases per day before the
test; since the promotion, generic sales have averaged 2-3

cases per day.

 

Source of Business - Based on informal observation, a majority
of purchasers appeared to be former generic smokers (many of

whom were former VICEROY smokers). Other major competitive °° =
sources of business were Winston, Marlboro or Pall Mall smokers.

3. Reasons For Not Purchasing - Those consumers who did not pur- .
chase VICEROYS said that they generally smoked low tar or
menthol cigarettes, were loyal to their own brand (particularly
Marlboro, RALEIGH and Kent smokers), or were VICEROY trier- =~

rejectors.
