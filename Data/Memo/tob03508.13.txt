FROM: William Kloepfer, Jr.

Based on. the decision of the Executive Committee to have

audience tests conducted for our movie and for the

Communications Committee's orovosed advertising, I

think it best for you to include single room requests

at the Homestead for Mr. Warren Donahue and Mr. Valentine

Appel both of New York, for the nights of Magy 24 and 25.
