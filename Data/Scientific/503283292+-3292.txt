‘The smoking apparatus employed was essentially stenderdy
The puff rate wed 2,5 880; ,puff every Bes ‘866,..0Fr a 2.5
puff followed by a 20 sec. apse. ‘

The Lemperatures observed during the smoking process--low. of. 68000)"
high of 800%, average of 742%--are in agreement with temperaturé
reported previously by Wynder, Graham and Croningsr (OANCER'R
13, 855(1953)) and by Cooper, i ndsey and Waller SEIT. MED
Nov. 18, 1964; CHEM. & IND.,2954, 1418).

The quantity of tar obteined represented 5-t0 10% of the’ Weight’ or.
a standard ] gm. cigarette. According to k¥xAK Schmahl, Co nsbruch >. *
end Druckrey (ARZNE]MIT#R.-FORSCH. , 4 71(1954)) 98% of: the ‘ter
inhaled is absoebed by the smoker. Seolkopf oaloulates that: 6
‘smoking 30 ciparettes per dey for 20 years would absorb from ‘
365, x £0 x 10 x 0.05 x 0.9&/3000 to “365 x 20 x 10 x 0.10 x 0. 98/1009".

or 3.6 to 7, 2 kem. ter.in 20 years.

The tar was fractionatdd into acidic, basic end neutral frectionss wa
The neutral fraction represented 37, Be of the total tar,
bistillation of this neutral fraction at reduced pressure gave.”
10 fractions boili_g from 70%/ 3 mm. to 290C/5 mm, and aet a
-residue of 9.8% of the Lote. Weight. of the. “tar. . oe

Chromatographic enalysis of these verious frections indicated: the |
presence of naphthalene (noncarcinogenic), anthracene (noncarcdno- _ .
genic) and $,4-benzpyrene (carcinogenic). : vo

The author estimates that 100 em. of cigarette tar contains 50 gene
(estimated spectrophotometrically) of 3,4-benzpyrene.

Cooper, lindsey and Waller (see above reference) estimate thet
&@ person smoking, 40 cigarettes per day would absorb 150 gamma of
3,4-benzpyrene per year Whereas a calculation using Secikopfts date
indjostes thet a person smoking 10 cigsrettes per day would
absorp 365 x 10 x 0.05 x 0.98 x 50/100 6°3.85 x 10 x 0.10 x 0198 x |

50/100 or 90 to 160 gamma of 3,4-benzpyrene per year.

It is interesting to note that the investigators (Cooper et al, sce
