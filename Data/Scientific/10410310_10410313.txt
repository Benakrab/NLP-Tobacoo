Deaths from uchzmic heart-disease in
18 developed countnes are not strongly
associated wih health-service factors such as doctor and
nurse density. There is a negative association with gross
national product per capita and a positive but mnconsis-
lent assocration with saturated and monounsaturated

fai intake. The principal finding 3 8 strong and specific
Negative assoqalon between schzmic heart-disease

deaths and alcohol consumption. This 1s shown to be
wholly attributable to we consumption.

Summary

INTRODUCTION

Ix a previous study! we reporied on the associations
between age-specific to1al mortahwy and a vanety of eco
nome, heatth-service, and dietary varsables in 18 devel-
oped countries. Our conclusion was that, in general, the
healih-service factors showed neghgible association with
morality, the dietary factors were of hitle amporiance,
and the only consistent pattern was 9 negative associ-
ation between gross nauonal product (G.N.P.) per
capita and mortality. Age-specific total mortality is,

_however, 8 crude measure by which to compare coun-

tries and so we have embarked upon a comparison of
parucular diseases. Here we shall present results for
heart-disease.

METHODS

The 18 countries used in this study are sted sn table 7. The
crueria for ther selection are sisted an our previous work!
Qur monalay data conssts of death-rates for males and
females separaicly in the 55-64 age-group from hypertensive
disease, uschemic heart-disease (3.4.0. ), cerebro-vasculor dis-
ease, and bronchiss plus emphyseme and asthma, and wr the
23-34 oge grovp death-rates from rosd accrdents. These
death-rates were obianed from the World Health Sratsucs
Annuel for 1970 (cades AB2, A83, ABS, A93, and AE138, res-
pectively). The lauer two causes of death were sncluded in the
study for comparsson with heart-dnease. 1) hos been suggested?
that France underreport 1.4.b. deaths and we made allowance
for this by analysing our dete with France ynrluded and

excluded.

Our heshh-service, economic, and demographic vanables
have been described elsewhere,’ as have agarene consumpion
Per capita per annum andtotal alcoho) consumpiion.

The only additronal vanables we used an this study were:

(1) Consumpnon (hires per caps per annum) of absolute
alcoho! atimbured separately (9 beer, wine, and spints.*

(2) Average daily imake of totel calories and carbohydrate,
and of total, sawwrsted, monounsaturated, and polyunsatu-
raed fat.’ Fat intake was also expressed as an energy percen-
vage of total calone intake. These figures were averaged over
the period 1954-62 which ws reasonable mn relatron to mortel-
sty on 1970.

(3° We also obranned daily cholesterol consumpnon? which,
together with toral saturated fais and polyunsaturated fats, we
inserted into Keys® predicuve equation for seram-cholestero).

Asin out previous study we edopted @ pragmauc approsch
to the statutical analysis. We examined scatter diograms of one
variable plowed against another and product moment correlo-
tion coefhuents. The venables showing the most convincing
associations with the desth-raies or with other “‘explanstory”
