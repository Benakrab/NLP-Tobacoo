Vulnerability of the Brain Revealed in New Book
Many people are vaguely aware of the power of the
human bean, which has sent messages to the farthest reaches
Of the solar system, but few are aware of its vulnerability to
quieks of temperature, chemistry, infection, and physical
Fmpact. It can be captured by the flood of hormones it sends

pulsing through the body, or taken hostage by outside events
even its own thoughts.

tions—what the brain is, how it functions, and how it is often
subverted. The creator of the unusual illustrations is Lydia
Kibiuk, a well-known medical illustrator based in Baltimore.

The Hostage Brain reveals the most recent advances
in brain research, but unlike other books on the brain, it
describes key discoveries together with the social and political
implications that surround them. It invites the reader to think
of the human brain as the organ that invented politics, philos-
ophy, all the arts, and even the uniquely human traits of
mercy and compassion. It is written to appeal to a broad
audience of adults and young people, including bright high
school students. It tempts everyone to think about their brains
and to wonder, in a more informed way than before, just why
we think and act the way we do.
