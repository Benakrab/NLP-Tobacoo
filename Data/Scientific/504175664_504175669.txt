A NEW PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF 1-MENTHENE EPOXIDES

SUMMARY:

Exploratory work has shown that the reaction of 1-menthene with
hypochlorous and hypobiomous acid forms halohydrins which upon treatment

with base yield 1-menthene epoxides. The preparation of menthene epoxides
by this method has not been previously reported.

The proposed invention is advantageous because it yields predominately
the trans isomer by a potentially cheaper method than is currently employed
for the preparation of a 1:1 mixture of the cis and trans l-menthene oxides.
trans epoxide is particularly valuable in that it can be stereospecifically

transformed to 2-menthene-l-ol, an important intermediate in the synthesis of
The menthene oxides are also useful as intermediates for the

menthol] (1).
preparation of a number of compounds which have desirable organoleptic
properties and are used extensively in flavorings and pharmaceuticals.
