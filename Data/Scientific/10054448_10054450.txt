form of ponderal index* present evi-
dence that men, on the average, show
a steady increase in weight from age
18 to 44, tittle change from 45 to 68,
and a decrease in weight from 64 on.

Since there appears to be a trend
toward increasing body weight in
male adylts below the age of 45, this
raises the question as to whether the
weight gained by former amokers is
attributable to smoking cessation or
is an effect of aging.

Unfortunately many of the studies
that have examined the relationship
of smoking cessation to weight gain
have foeused on cross-sectionaldata.""
An analysis based on longitudinal
data, the Comatock and Stone study,"
confounds the problem by using 8 re-
stricted age range (40 to 60 years)
and by not having controlled for the
fact that men (undifferentiated for
amoking habita) below the age of 45
years tend to gain weight as they get
older.

age-weight factor is controlled

This permits a determination of the
portion of weight change attributable
to smoking habit and the part attrib-

Materiel and Methods

The subjects in this study were 870
healthy, adult male veterans ages 20 to 69
years who live and work in the greater
Boston ares. The subjects are part of
a larger population of about 2190 men who
are enrolled in the Normative Aging
Stady, a longiadinal stody Cat begen it

Tho 870 were men for whom cigarette
smoking information was available at two
successive time periods, time 1 (1963 to
1969) and time 2 (1970 to 1978). The Nor-
mative Aging Stady is part of the in:
tramural medical research program of the
Yoterans Adininistration and is located in
the Boston Veterans Administration Out-
patient Clinic.'* Subjects undergo a bat-
tery of tests in many disciplines in & recur-
ring five-year cycle. every five

logical variables, as well as medical history
information en each subject

A twoway analysis of variance was
used to help decide whether cigarette
emoking change and chronological age
wero significantly associated with weight
change over & five-year period. ln this
study, smoking behavior was examined

only in regard to cigarette emoking.
