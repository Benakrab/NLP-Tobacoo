total incidence of the disease has risen ten-fold in the last 30 years in Taiwan
(Yang et al. 1959) and three-fold in the last 10 years in Japan. If the proportion
of adenocarcinoma was solely related to the total incidence of the disease, then
the proportion of this type of tumcur should have fallen with the dramatic rise.

The site of the tumours also seems to be different in the two parts of the

world in that peripheral carcinomas account for over half the cases in the Far
East as against w quarter in Europe (Yang et al. 1969; Ishikawa 1969; Lee &
