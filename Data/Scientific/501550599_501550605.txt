Introduction

. The findings on the occurrence ond the quantities of
N-nitrosanincs in tobacco snoke are often biased by the
. different uncertainties due to the fornation of the
. Hi-nitroso conpounds and thoir nitrogen-oxygen p. ccursors

ap analytical artofacts (Keurath, 1972).

ct - Gherofore an investigation of the reaction steps necessa-
rily involved in the formation of those carcinogens in

tobacco snoke is an urgent task which should be undertaken

in order to obtain reliable basic data.
