after photobleaching experiments show that there is heterogeneity
in the diffusion Characteristics of lymphocyte membrane proteins.
SIg is relatively immobile when labeled by Fab! and is immobilized
by F(ab'),. RT diffuses 2.7 times as fast as S!g and the mobile
fraction bf RTl is greater. When RTL is cross-linked by relatively
Tow concentrations of F(ab"), its mobility is about the Same as
that of SIg. When the concehtration of F(ab’), is increased, RT
is immobilized. Thy-1 diffuses faster than sig and has a higher
mobile fraction. then thy-] is labeled with F{ab’)}, it remains
