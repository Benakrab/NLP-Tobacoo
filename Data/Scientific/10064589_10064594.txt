Synthesis of 16a-hydroxy-17-oxo stervids 3, Sb, and 6b and 36,16a-dihydrozy-6-17-ozoandrasten-3-yl sulfate
(2) from 16a-bromo-17-ox0 steroids 1, 5a, and 6a and the reaction mechanism of the controlled alkaline hydrolysis
are described. Treatment of the bromo ketones with NaQH in aqueous DMF gave the 16c-hydroxy 17-ketones
sterenoelectively in 95% yield without formation of other ketols. The eodium salt of 3-sulfate 7 was also obtained
in ons step in 85% yield from the bromo ketone (fa). Isotope-labeling experiments and time-course
studies showed that equilibration between the 16-bromo epimera Il and 2 precedes the formation of 8, in which
the true intermediate is 2 and not 1, and that the ketal 8 is formed by the direct S,2 displacement of the
166-bromine. The 169-mcrpholino derivative 8 obtained by reaction of | with morpholine was shown to be an
isomerized product of the 16a isomer which is produced also by S,2 displacement of the 168-bromine. The
mechanism of keto! rearrangement of 3 to the 178-hydroxy-16-o20 compound 4 was found to involve a hydration
to the carbonyl function. The new hydration-dehydration mechanism is proposed for the ketol rearrangement.

Steroidal ring-D 16,17-ketols, especially 16a-hydroxy Scheme I
17-ketones, have been known es major metabolites of C-18 CH30 Na e R
and C-19 steroids and also as potentially useful interme- ar NH,NH, “9
diates in the synthesis of ring-D 16,17-glycols. It is de- —_——»> j > on
sirable to provide a generally applicable and eimple syn-
theais for these compounds. The previous observations
