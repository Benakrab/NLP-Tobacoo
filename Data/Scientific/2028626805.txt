SACCHARIN

Several tipping papers and one reference tipping paper
sample were analyzed for saccharin. The qualitative and
quantitative analyses were performed by HPLC. The method
involved acid (0.05N H,S0,) and diethyl ether extraction
and determination on aâ€™ C8 column (15 cm) with water, acetic

acid, methanol (59/1/40) eluent.

All results were confirmed by Gc*/MS after gerivatization
of saccharin to N-methyl saccharin (2) by M (197) and
fragmentation. Results have been submitted to OC PME

(3) (4).

At the request of QC PME. a rather simple spot test for the
presence of sodium saccharin on TP is being sought. The

precipitation reaction between a dilute acidic silver nitrate

solution and sodium saccharin seems promising. Work is
continuing concerning the sensitivity and the selectivity

of the method.
