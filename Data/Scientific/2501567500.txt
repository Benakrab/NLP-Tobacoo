21 d-inhalation study on male rats with 2R1 standard
reference cigarettes, paraffin and DOS.

Dear Doctor Osdene,

1 BASIC EXPERIMENTAL CONCEPT

The 21 d-inhalation study -/3016 with male rats started on Aug. 13
and ended on Sept. 3, 1979 (last exposure day: Sept. 2, 1979).

This inhalation study was designed to investigate the response
of the laryngeal epithelium to aerosols of paraffin and DOS
bacic acid-bis(2-ethylhexyl) ester) in doses comparable to TPM
doses oi igarettés, nistered during standard 21 d-smoke
inhalation studies. Other bioassays, the responses of which wera

' investigated, were: specific AHM activity in liver, kidney, free

lung celis and lavaged lung, specific O-demethylase activity in

liver, kidney and lavaged lung as well as phagocytosis and phago-
luminescence of free lung cells. _

' Grouping: on

0.1-GR, sham exposure in an exposure chamber not connected to a
smoking machine

©.2-GR, sham exposure in an exposure chamber connected to a
smoking machine without cigarettes
1-GR, low daily TPM dose, diluted smoke of 2R1 cigarettes

2~-GR, high daily TPM dose (2times low dose), diluted smoke
of 2R1 cigarettes An

3-GR, low daily dose of paraffin aerosol

4-GR, high daily dose (2 times low dose) of paraffin aerosol
S-GR, low daily dose of DOS aerosol

.6=GR, high daily dose (2 times low dose) of DOS aerosol

Each group contained 60 rats.

The rats were not exposed on the day of sacrifice. All rats were
Starved from 06.00 the day before until sacrifice. Water was
given ad libitum except during exposure,

If applicable, data were tested for statistically significant de-

-viation from the O.1-GR, F- and t-test, two-tailed.
