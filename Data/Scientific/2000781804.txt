oo : _ In order to determine whether there is a subjective impact of
mye ART stems attributable to monopotassium citrate, pilot RU was a
mo made iin TC, 150B and! Modified 1508 formulations with citrate .
Ly added to the size. Citrate levels simulated replacing 1/3, 2/3
and all of. the bright stems in normal RL feedstcck with ART
stems. Handmade cigarettes were submitted for subjective
screening. .

The effect of citrate on RL fiber processing was evaluated ty
adding! manopotassium citrate to process liquors (S8w, RW) and
tiber chests. Both test and control were targeted at 17%
baseweb HWS to approximate Park 500. Citrate to HWS ratios
were maintained at am elevated level, equivalent to reglacing
all bright stems iim the feedstock with ART stems. There wa5-a
slight increase in sheet adhesion to the Yankee Dryer. Sheet
tenstle strength was somewhat lower, but additional resting
willl be required to. determine statistical signiticance. There
were mo measurable differences in paper machine muisture
protile, tines retention or drainage rates. The system
developed several leaks at threaded tittings, gaskets and ro at ¢)
seals. This is attributes to a Cleaning action on sediments
due to the slight acidity and considerable Chelating oracerties
