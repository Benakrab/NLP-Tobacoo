Smoking. At the present
the cigarette company's are stressing various filters to
eliminate to some exte

nt the harming Substances of contents,
MY question was as follows

 

Iam a cigarette smoker, I do not inhale, I do not smoke cigars
and I rarely sinoke a package a day. While tyeing this letter I
was snoking one of the 100's Marlboro Cigarettes. I puffed on

it customarily and also placed it in my ash tray between the
puffing sequence. It finall

y down to the tpped part and it took
exactly 10 minutes. So now where des a certain ci
a 7 minute cigarette. I usually smoke the 100's of Pall Malj,
Winston and L & M.
