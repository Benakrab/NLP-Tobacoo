Re: Case #2037 :
Dear Dr. Robinson:

Your recent inquiry concerning support by this
Council of a proposed research study has now been
considered by the members of the Scientific Advisory
Board.

They asked me to notify. you that they cannot
encourage formal application for support of this study
at the present time.

We trust that you wild obtain the support you
seek elsewhere.

Sincerely yours,
