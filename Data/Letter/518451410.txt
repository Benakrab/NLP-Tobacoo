sent. The list also includes the quantity sent to each locatioit,

Many of you have been asking if (hese fixtures have any value, Reading this Ictter you can clearly sec that

Albertson's does. They are very happy with what these fixtures are doing in their stores. They attribute a |

fair portion of their sales increase to this program. Please continue lo support this fixture program as
» much as possible.

~ Thank you again for all your help and cooperation. ‘If you should have any questions or concerns please
