used for the analysis of vanillin, ethyl vanillin, piperonal, and coumarin in
smoking tobacco, the analysis of vanillin in filter rods, and the analysis of
coumarin in cigarettes can also be used for the analysis of cocoa in tobacco
products using the same mobile phase that was used on the Whatman ODS-2 column
