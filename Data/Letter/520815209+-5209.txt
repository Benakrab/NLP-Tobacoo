RE: RJR adv. State

Dear Tom: j
This letter responds to your February 18, 1999 letter which was prompted by the February - ’
10, 1999 memorandum from the Attom

ey General of the State of Washington to our Attomey
General Janet Napolitano and eleven att

‘oreys general. Unfortunately, Ms. Gregoire’s memo was
written almost two weeks following the one and only Winston Blues Revival

| planned for Arizona.
That event was held at the Cajun House in Scottsdale oni January 28, 1999,

It is my understanding that RJ Reynolds Tobacco plans no other Winston Blues Revival
concerts for Arizona. ‘

Ifyou have any other questions, feel free to contact me,

Sincerely,

GOODWIN RAUP PC
