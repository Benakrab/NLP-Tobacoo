one year, and a copy of a paper related to that work,
which, as you will note, has been accepted for publication
in the British Medical Journal.

“cov = As you know, it now appears that this research

and, under appropriate circumstances, might well be able
/ to provide useful information to a Congressional Comnittee
i or other body inquiring into certain aspects of smoking
and health. Indeed, some of the work that he is doing on
smoking and pregnancy, while focused on the smoking mother,
would suggest that he might have important information to
impart in any consideration of claims of effects of smoking
