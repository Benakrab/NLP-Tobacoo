Dear Mr. Ramu,

I am a third year student at the University of Michigan —
Law School and I am researching the problem of whether the
Federal Trade Commission has the authority to promulgate Trade -
Regulation Rules. I would appreciate it very much if you

.. would send me a oopy of. the memorandum which you submitted

to the FTC on this matter. My specific concern is whether

the Commission has the power in connection with cigarette

labeling and advertising.
Thank you very much.

Sincerely yours,

Edwerd Levy
