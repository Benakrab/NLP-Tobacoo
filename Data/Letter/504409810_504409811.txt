SUBJECT: Weekly Highlights
Process Technology & Development

I. NEW PROCESS DEVELOPMENT
° Carbonization of Stems

In PT&D's ongoing work to support use of carbonized
tobacco in products, a novel method of carbonizing stems

’ is under development. Bench scale tests are underway
utilizing plasma are welding equipment to simultaneously
and virtually instantaneously deliver extremely high
temperatures directly to the stems in an inert atmo-
Sphere thus avoiding ignition of the stems. This work
could lead to a continuous method of carbonizing vs. the
current batch methods which take times ranging from 1 to
5 days, depending on batch size.

II. PT&D SUPPORT SERVICES

o Freon Storage ‘in 611-7

The Freon storage tank originally at Shed 130 has been
relocated to the East end of 611-7. The tank will
provide increased storage capacity and will free Space
inside 611-7 to better support G-13 developmental
activities.
