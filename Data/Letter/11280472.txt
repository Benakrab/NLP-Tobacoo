Dear Or, Crane:

Ry attention has been called to your syndicated coluen
under the headline, “Cigaret Smoke Can Kein Blood Tranafusdion”,
in which you state that carbon monoxide permanently destroya red
bleed cells. If this ia the case, it te, of course, of great
practical impertance and I would appreciate it very mich if you
could refer ne to the source of any evidence supporting your

eoant.

It is, of course, veld known thet carbon monazide hae
a strong affinity for hemoglabin and displaces oxygen from oxy~
hemoglobin, However, according te current texts and other medical
writing, thia ie a revereible reaction. The amount of carbon
monoxide combined at any point in time is determined by the
propertion of oxyyen to carbon monoxide in the environment. This
ia the basia for the use of oxygen in treating carbon monoxide
poisoning; thus promating the rapid elimination of carbon monoxide
and speeding recovery.

Any sofentific references you can send me which will
suppert your peaition would be meet weloone,

Sincerely yours,

MoKecn Cattell, M.D.
