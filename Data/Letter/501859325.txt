§

Dear Dr. Senkus:

We remind you of our letter of March 14 in which
e pointed out that we are restricted to only one claim in
the subject Japanese patent application. We have instructed

our associates to file a claim for a process of improving
tobacco by adding thereto the specified additive.

We can, if desired, file a divisional application
directed to the process of preparing the tobacco additive.
If a divisional application is to be filed we should do so
within the next several weeks. May we please have your
instructions in this matter.

Very truly yours,
PRIODLETON, NEUMAN, SEIBOLD & WILLIAMS
