Dear Allan, t

As ve discussed over the phone, I would be pleased to supply you with our
IL-3 derivative for use in your anticipated IL-3 receptor studies and in
Support of your grant application. Dr. Linda Park will be the individual
at Immunex who will provide you with the protein and ansver any questions
you might have on the radiolabeling of the molecule. I have taken the

@ liberty of enclosing two reprints describing studies in which the IL-3
derivative has been used. Dr. Park will be in contact with you at her
earliest convenience to arrange shipment of the protein.

I appreciate your willingness to consider Immunex as an active collaborator
in your studies and look forward to hearing the results of your
experiments.

Yours sincerely,
