RE: Grant No, 2257
Dear Mr. Gertenbach: '

We were delighted to learn of the award of the above grant
to support our work on DNA ligase. I enclose a new budget and
other materials as requested, Although the award is for a lesser
amount than we requested and for one year, it wil] be an enormous
help in fulfilling ovr goals.

There is no overlap between the goals of this grant and that
awarded by the National Cancer Institute to Dr. John Chan which
will focus upon the molecular biological studics aimed at
analyzing the gene involved in this disease, The studies
supported by the Council under Grant No. 2257 will be focused
upon the enzymology of the human cells. The appointment of Dr.
Heahyun Yoo to this aspect of the project is to achieve that
specific purpose. Dr. Yoo, a research associate in my
laboratory, has an extensive background in enzymology as is
evident by her CV and bibliography (enclosed).

Once again we thank you for this generous award and assure
you of our efforts to guarantee its success,

Sincerely yours,

Ledovcl 1 (BeluiitD
