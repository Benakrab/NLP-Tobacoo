BACKGROUND

This study was designed to examine the shape of the psychophysical
curve relating perceived sidestream smoke attribute magnitude to the
percent wet particulate matter left in the sidestream smoke. Previous
studies have examined the effect of total removal of particulate
matter and include Irritation Tests 1,2,3 and & (report on Irritation
Test 6 will be forthcomming).

METHODS

Testing was similar to that reported by Gayle Ryan in SED Test Report
No. API.

CAMEL LIGHT 85's were chosen on the basis of draft (12.2 to 13.4 cm
H20) and % air dilution (27% to 34%), Product manipulation was as
follows:

+ 92.5% WIPM - filter holder without filter

» SS.5% WPM ~ filter with two fat short tubes.

34.6% WIPM - filter with one fat short tube.

17.5% WIPM - filter with one long skinny tube.

15.5% WIPM - filter with no dilution tubes.

The filter holder was placed directly above the smoking chamber with

the aid of a Delryn connector. A similar connector was placed on top
of the filter holder to which a Teflon Tee was attached. Also to this
were the dilution air and the exit tube to the soliniod box.

The method for callibrating the filter pads is described in Appendix
a.

fs in prior tests Gayle Ryan was responsible for subject performance
evaluations and statistical analysis. Ruth Webb and Saundra Jacobs
shared the responsibilities for arranging test schedules, running the

test and data entry

Evaluations were performed on 9 sensory attributes (attachment 1)
using unstructured line scales (attachment 2).

RESULTS

The results of manipulating wet particulate matter is shown in Graphs
1, 2, 3 and 4, Generally, the attributes of Impact, Eye Irritation,
Nasal Irritation, Astringent, Ashtray and Paper are decreased
