@ Attended a meeting with representatives from the Coupon Redenption
Center to finalize coding and tabulation specifications for the
BRIGHT Screening Questionnaire. This questioansire is designed to
identify full-tise and part-time users of the Brand as well as
occasional users. Response thus fer to the mail-out questionnaire

has been higher than anticipated. Roughly 10,000 returns have been
received during the first week following mail-out. In addition to

providing smokers for BRIGHT's Identified 2-Puck/Carton Test, ve
expect to receive enough names to use in 8 number of other research
projects. A copy of the screening status is attached.

e@ Issued an analysis of BRIGHT 100's Cospetitive Product Test. While
only two waves of BRIGHT's Competitive Test are complete, Wave I was
boosted to allow for a full sample following the completion of Wave
11. Overall ratinge indicate that 65.0% of total low tar menthol
18+ acceptors rated BRIGRT 100 70+. Additionally, 54.52 of full

flavor wenthol 18+ acceptors rated the Brand 70+. While BRIGHT’ s
1983 Competitive Testing does not include a mentnol competitor,
these results indicate that BRIGHT 100‘s acceptance among its
primery target group (low tar menthol acceptors) ic high.
