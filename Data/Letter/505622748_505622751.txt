I. ADVANCED PROCESS TECHNOLOGY

o Extraction Investigation

Tobacco Processing completed their evaluation of the
prototype Chemi-Washer extractor in 112 Shed and is pre-
paring specifications for a unit to be designed espe-

‘ cially for tobacco materials. APT personnel have as-
sumed operating responsibility for the rented unit and
will begin test plans the week of April 21. Charac-
terization of the-wiped-film evaporator and spray dryer,
and evaluation of the processed materials continued.

II. PROCESS DEVELOPMENT

o Primary Pilot Line, R&D Plant, 611-3

The AR to fund the rotary dryer addition to the R&D
plant is now being reviewed prior to circulation for
approval. Engineering has completed preliminary equip-
ment layouts and when these are signed off by R&D,
detailed design will begin. The detailed specifications
on the dryer have been received from Hauni but the final
price has not been received. Although there has been
slippage, the scheduled completion remains May 1987.
