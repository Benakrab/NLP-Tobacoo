“Re: Maxwell Report (Page 5 Attached) .

-1. The attached document may seem rather long; however, it is essential
. in this form to follow-through with the rational involved.

2, Claude Teague's summary on the first page and a half explains that
apparently: .

_ (a) A gap exists in brands on the market because no cigarette has both oy .
an acceptable Jevel of nicotine and a "tar"-to-nicotine ratio: (T/N Ratio)
of less than 13. (T/N Ratio: divide FTC "tar" by FTC nicotine. )

. (b) Perhaps we should go for developing a cigarette delivering 1.3 mg. of -

nicotine and 13 mg. of "tar." _ ot -

“() This would provide a . product with a "desirable" T/N Ratio of 10.

3. Kool is the only brand that falls close to 13 at 13, 1% T/N Ratio; however,
even this is substantially over the 10 that appears to be what we should be -
| shotting for if the Maxvell Report is a reliable reference, Carlton's ratio -
gives a , TIN Ratio of 10 ("tar" 4 mg., nicotine 0.4 mg.); however, at or near
- our specified nicotine delivery value of 1.3 mg., there is no brand witha | oe
TIN Ratio of less than 13. : vo Soe

4, Ate our specified nicotine level of 1.3 mg. the smoker must receive at. ne
least 17 mg. of "tar" as applied to any current brand. No other option is
is available -- which appears to be a gap and an unmet need, or marketing
. Opportunity. Research believes it can come up with a product to fill this .
. gap with consumer acceptance, . . ee 2 Se

 

5. Perhaps Consumer Research should look at this more closely. :
