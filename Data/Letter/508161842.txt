Re: DORAL II Size Reduction

The size reduction program as I understand it has already been approved
by Dr. Laurene, with Marketing concurrence, earlier this year, and
Dr. J. D. Woods provided suggested specifications on that basis.
see it appropriate for QA to issue new specifications to Manufacturing.
By this note, I ask that anyone who sees these actions, reducing

DORAL II to 24.8 mm., as unauthorized, to notify me immediately.
