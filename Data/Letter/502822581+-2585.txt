Dear Mr. Pinney:

Thank you for your invitation to participate in the
"Working Meeting: Research Needs on Low-Yield Cigarettes",

The following are som: of the guestions which I believe
bear examination in future research on the effects of cigarette
smoking on the pregnant mother, the fetus and placenta, and the
child. As you will note many are those I formulated for the
chapter on Pregnancy and Infant Health for the 1979 Surgeonâ€™
General's Report on Smoking and Health. (I apologize for the
sketchy nature of some of these questions, but I am writing

this letter during a few hours between a trip to Boston and
another to Amsterdam.)

Lactation and Breast Feeding

i. By what mechanism does nicotine affect prolactin eS:
release, and can this phenomenon be reversed? _

2. To what extent is nicotine excreted in breast
milk ingested by the nursing infant? -

3. What other components of cigarette smoke are
secreted in significant amounts in breast milk?

4. Do interactions between nicotine and other drugs
such as benzo(a)pyrene excreted in breast milk ---- ..
affect newborn physiology?
