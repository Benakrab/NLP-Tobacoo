Dear Hans :

After talking to you I had Cleve Laird prepare an
application-type statement for a supplement to our current
contract between Bio-Research Institute,Inc.and CTR to enable
us to study respiratory sounds and certain other physiological '
parameters in smoke-exposed Syrian hamsters.Preliminary work
showed that this non-destructive approach promises to furnish
a wealth of information relatively soon after beginning the
exposure.Once the comparison between in vivo sound tracings,
respiratory frequencies and magnitudes and anatomical findings
wil< have been made this will provide a new approach to the L
study of effects of smoke upon pulmonary function and health,

Unfortunately through an unbelievable mix-up in the mails
this material,mailed from Boston on. August 13th reached me this
morning.No time remains now for cleaning it up and I am sending
it to you in its present draft form which conveys the meaning.

I hope you can convince your colleagues on the CTR advi-
sory committee that this is a worthwhile effort end that we can
get the funds to purchase the equipment which we have current.y
borrowed and improvised ,

I am sending Bob Hockett copies of all of this so that he
is informed of our discussions,

With ,any thanks and best regards, a

P,S, I just learned that Dr.lisanti visited us today and is Vid,
informed on this.It is important that we get immediate echhonay Hombuyé er

so that we can use for study the animals now being exposed,
Fu/s The Grass equipment now being used is only a loan to us

and I do not know how long we can keep it.
