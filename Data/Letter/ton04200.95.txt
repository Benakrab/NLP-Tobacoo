Gentiemen:

Enclosed are three items I received recently bearing on smokers’ rights and
proposed taxes and restrictions on the use of tobacco:

One is an article by Bruce Herschensohn published in HUMAN EVENTS newspaper
titled "Let Free Market Decide Smoking Rules," a concept I totally agree with,

as the free market has always proven to be far more effective than government
regulation,

Another enclosure is a mailing I received (as publisher of a national news-
paper) from a public relations firm including a short article on the subject
of the regulation of tobacco use. Well written and full of useful information.

The final enclosure is a publication from Florida Tax Watch (a non-profit
state government watchdog organization) expressing the unsound proposal of a

proposed incrdéase in the state tax on tobacco.

I hope you may be able to use some portion of these enclosures in your contin-
uing efforts to protect the rights of smokers in our supposedly free country.

Sincerely,
