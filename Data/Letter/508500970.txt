Dear Dr. Leake,

Thank you for sending me the interesting results from your
evaluation cf 3M's Expantrol V intumescent granules. while ch3
results do net initially appear encouraging, at least they offer

possible directions for improvement. Some ideas inmediately cane
to minds

~- Change the particle size tc optimize adherence. ‘e have
secently determined that smaller particles give Setter
adherence.

- Restrict use of the additive to only filter cigarettes to
aliminate the grit problem. Our results also show scme

filters work better than others in preventing parcicle
migration.

- Bord the particles to a percentage of the tcbacco in
"secondary" casing cperation using a water soluticn.

& will be meeting with our tebacco consultant, Me. Rooert
CundifZ, in early February to explore additionai “new” approaches
to poss.bly incorporating Expantrol V into cigarettes. ‘We would
appreciate continuing our discussions with american Tobaces anc .
thanx you for your interest.

Sincerely, .? , .
