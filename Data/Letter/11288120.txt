Mr. W.T.Hoyt

President

Council for Tobacco Research
110 E. 59th St.

New York, N.Y. 10023

Dear Mr. Hoyt,

I am interested in information on tobacco research,
an would appreciate any information you could send

me. I am particularly curious about any research you
have on tobacco advertising.

Does the Council feel that some media will alter
their media content to avoid offending cigarette
manufacturers? What is your policy on This?

Thank you for your time and consideration.
